Bootstrap was used to design the calculator outlay and a level of responsiveness for mobile view. 

JavaScript was the main language used to calculate the math problems. :construction: 

I plan to build onto this small project to eventually make it to a scientific calculator. 

### Built with :wrench: :
* Front-end Framework — [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* Deployment — [Githubpages](https://pages.github.com/)
